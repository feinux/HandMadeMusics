# HandMadeMusics

These music files I made for fun. 

I don't have any music composition/mix experience, any advises/suggestions/critics/tech/tutorias would be appreciated.

l'm not sure about the genre so I simply named all ringtone files by numbers, like rimgtone1, ringtone2 ... So if you can define it's genre please let me know. ^_^ 

I convert both mp3 and m4r format, for ringtone projects.
